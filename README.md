# sketching-space-invaders
This is a version of space invaders created with Racket #lang [Sketching](https://soegaard.github.io/sketching/) as a demonstration/tutorial of the language

I was going to turn this into a proper website tutorial but I ran out of steam. However, the commits in this repo are structured in the manner the tutorial would have been. If you want to follow along, start from the first commit. 

## Why Sketching?
Racket usually has tutorials on how to program in a functional style. This is nice but writing software incrementally in that style has always felt cumbersome to me, perhaps due to my inexperience? So I wanted to write a tutorial that uses an incremental approach and an imperative style. Sketching is very good for this (it also tends to have better performance)

## Further improvements
I could have added more features, but you can too! Try adding destructable barriers like the original, or maybe better explosion graphics using particles. Or perhaps sound or menus?

## Other works
Heres some other racket space invaders implementations/tutorials which I took inspiration from

 - Uses an object oriented style, and is very good looking

https://alex-hhh.github.io/2020/11/space-invaders.html

 - Implements space invaders using several Racket frameworks, all in a functional style

 - A very proper big bang implementation with unit tests and everything
